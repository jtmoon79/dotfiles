# dotfiles

_Putting the . in ._

Miscellaneous user dot files for consistent user shell environments. Also a place to store various small scripts for various tasks.

The most extensively developed are the bash `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and `.bash_logout` initialization files. See [`install.sh`](./install.sh) header comment for fast installation instructions of those bash initialization files.
